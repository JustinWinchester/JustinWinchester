            <p>Cameron University’s ACM Technology club organized a trash pickup day at a local park in the Lawton, OK Comanche County district, Elmer Thomas Park. I was involved with this group in helping to remove garbage from the surrounding area, we organized a small group of Computer science students who met on Saturday of March 27, 2021, to collect the unwanted trash from the area. Our group met at the park wearing our university shirts, prepared ourselves with gloves, bag, and some minor garbage grabbing equipment and filled bags of trash from the park for several hours.

            <p>The 2021 Capstone project, at Cameron University, in the computer science department consisted of senior computer science students divided into two teams to complete a functional software application. The two teams were tasked with designing and developing a web-based student enrollment and advisement application.
I was hired as the team project lead for team #1.  My task was to lead team 1 to develop a web-based student enrollment system that contained three basic components: (1) front end web forms (HTML/JavaScript/CSS), (2) middleware server-side scripts (PHP), and a (3) back-end database (SQL/MySQL).  The software development experienced five stages: requirement, analysis, design, implementation, and testing. A deliverable software was completed at the end of this process.

Algorithms implemented in this project were used to schedule various operations in waiting queues, and then the program, analyzes the output of the scheduling tasks based on these algorithms to figure the average waiting and turn around time for these algorithms. An example of algorithms used include general algorithms used to access these performance analytics such as the FCFS (First Come First Serve), SJF (Shortest Job First), or RR (Round Robin) time quantum for example.</p>

This project focused on using programming skills, artistic design, project presentation skills, mathematics, and general game development techniques to learn to build a functional and deployable computer game. The game I developed in accessible online via a desktop computer in any modern web browser. The game can also be downloaded and accessed. The game development process consisted of using C# coding scripts to integrate the environment and gaming features into a modern 3-dimensional platformer game. This game has a point collection system, is time based, and has multiple levels for player experience.</p>
