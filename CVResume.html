          <p>I began my culinary work for this restaurant, learning the sauté station in Orange City, FL. Following further development and experience I learned all culinary positions including prep. I transferred via Darden systems to a location in Lawton, OK to assist a family member stationed in the military at Ft. Sill. I learned more positions around the restaurant after transferring to this location due to high turn-over rates in the restaurant, including dish -washing and making salads. I worked hard to meet all culinary standards in the restaurant and eventually mainly worked as the main assembler for the cooking line stations. I learned all recipes and executed them according to my training modules and recipe charts and then received promotion to Culinary Professional in which I worked as Culinary Professional for my department on different shifts, before beginning school. I was chosen to go and train and assist other culinary departments at different locations for Olive Garden when they were short employees or training new ones.
            I also received employee of the month many times throughout the course of my employment and eventually quit to focus on my education during a difficult and busy school semester.

I learned and demonstrated punctuality and responsibility as I rose through the ranks from painter’s assistant to general laborer and was enrolled in blue-print reading,
 and design training courses. We were responsible for wrapping and protecting chemical pipes in pipe racks located throughout the Chlorine block of the chemical plant. Scaffolds were built around the pipe- racks in which we traveled through wearing safety harness, construction belts, hard-hats, mono-goggles, and practicing 100% tie-off safety precautions throughout the scaffolding as job duties were performed. The job consisted of daily safety meetings and constant safety checks of personal protective equipment.

            <p>Cameron University’s ACM Technology club organized a trash pickup day at a local park in the Lawton, OK Comanche County district, Elmer Thomas Park. I was involved with this group in helping to remove garbage from the surrounding area, we organized a small group of Computer science students who met on Saturday of March 27, 2021, to collect the unwanted trash from the area. Our group met at the park wearing our university shirts, prepared ourselves with gloves, bag, and some minor garbage grabbing equipment and filled bags of trash from the park for several hours.

            <p>The 2021 Capstone project, at Cameron University, in the computer science department consisted of senior computer science students divided into two teams to complete a functional software application. The two teams were tasked with designing and developing a web-based student enrollment and advisement application.
I was hired as the team project lead for team #1.  My task was to lead team 1 to develop a web-based student enrollment system that contained three basic components: (1) front end web forms (HTML/JavaScript/CSS), (2) middleware server-side scripts (PHP), and a (3) back-end database (SQL/MySQL).  The software development experienced five stages: requirement, analysis, design, implementation, and testing. A deliverable software was completed at the end of this process.
